## Important Note
When this project was developed, the Hugging Face Inference API allowed free access for image generation.  
Currently, the API requires a paid subscription for image generation requests.

Although the API may not work without payment now, this project remains a valuable demonstration of how AI-powered image generation apps can be built using modern web technologies and APIs.  
You can still explore the full functionality, UI/UX design, and API integration flow through the code.

## Project Status
This project is complete and fully functional in terms of code and structure.
